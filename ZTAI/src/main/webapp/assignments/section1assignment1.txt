1. Simple File Download (Thread Interruption and Monitoring):

	Create a thread to download a file from a URL.
	Implement thread interruption to gracefully stop the download if needed (e.g., using a flag).
	Monitor the download progress and provide feedback (e.g., percentage downloaded).

2. Simple Producer-Consumer (Thread Communication):
	Create two threads: a producer and a consumer.
	The producer adds items to a shared buffer (e.g., an array).
	The consumer removes items from the buffer and processes them.
	Implement synchronization (e.g., wait-notify) to ensure the consumer doesn't access empty buffers and the producer doesn't overflow.
